					What is Java?<br>
				</header>
				<p>
					Java is a general purpose programming
					language and widely used now a days '
					for competitive programming.<br> It has
					imperative, object-oriented and generic
					programming features. Java runs on lots of
					platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
					C++ is an efficient
					and powerful language and finds wide use
					in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
					real-time simulations.<br>
                </p>
				<p>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
					<br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
					Programming are :<br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inheritance</li><br>
					<li>Polymorphism</li><br>
					<li>Abstraction</li><br>
					<li>Encapsulation</li><br>
				</ul>

					Inheritance<br>
				</header>
				<p>
					The capability of a class to derive
					properties and characteristics from
					another class is called Inheritance.
					Inheritance is one of the most important
					feature of Object Oriented Programming.<br>
					Sub Class: The class that inherits
					properties from another class
					is called Sub class or Derived Class.<br>
					Super Class: The class whose properties
					are inherited by sub class is called Base
					Class or Super class.<br> Using inheritance, we
					have to write the functions only one time
					instead of three times as we
					have inherited rest of the three classes
					from base class(Vehicle).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Types of Inheritance : </b>
                    <br>
					<b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
					Inheritance is a feature of java where a
					class can inherit from more than one
					classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
					from more than one base classes.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, a derived class is
					created from another derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, more than one sub
					class is inherited from a single base
					class i.e. more than one derived class
					is created from a single base class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
					Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
					combining more than one type of
					inheritance.
					For example: Combining Hierarchical
					inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

					Polymorphism<br>
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.<br>
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.
					<br>
					<b>Polymorphism is mainly
						divided into two types:</b><br>
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism<br>

					Abstraction<br>
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> 
                    Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.<br>

				<header>
					Encapsulation<br>
				</header>
				<p>
					In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them. <br>Consider
					a real life example
					of encapsulation, in a company there are
					different sections like the accounts section,
					finance section, sales section etc. The finance
					section handles all the financial transactions
					and keep records of all the data related to
					finance.<br>
					Similarly the sales section handles all the
					sales related activities and keep records of
					all the sales.
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. In the above example the data of
					any of the section like sales, finance or
					accounts is hidden from any other section.
